Our analysis will focus on the annual average ambient concentrations of PM 2.5 based on seasonal averages and daily measurement, and we will be looking at the data from 2008 to 2011. We chose these years because we wanted to get an idea of the most recent air quality measures from the data.\n\nconcentrations <- air_quality |>\n  filter(MeasureName == \"Annual average ambient concentrations of PM 2.5 in micrograms per cubic meter, based on seasonal averages and daily measurement (monitor and modeled data)\",\n         ReportYear >= 2008) |>\n  select(StateName, CountyName, ReportYear, Value) |>\n  rename(avg_concentration = Value)\n\nThe distribution of average county PM 2.5 concentration in the United States from 2008-2011 can be seen with a histogram.\n\nconcentrations |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = avg_concentration)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5,\n                 fill = 'steelblue', \n                 color = 'black') +\n  labs(x = \"Annual Average Concentration of PM 2.5 (micrograms per cubic meter)\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Distribution of County Fine Particle Concentration\",\n       caption = \"data from 'Air Quality Measures on the National Environmental Health \\n Tracking Network' collected by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\",\n       subtitle = \"2008 - 2011\")\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of annual average PM 2.5 concentrations is right skewed, so there are a few counties with large outliers. In general, concentrations range between about 4 and 22 micrograms per cubic meter. The peak occurs at 10 micrograms per cubic meter.\nFor our analysis, we will be using the median annual average PM 2.5 concentration as our summary statistic rather than the mean. Because the distribution is skewed, the median would be more representative of the centre of the data than the mean.\n\nconcentrations |>\n  summarize(med_concentration = median(avg_concentration))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  med_concentration\n              <dbl>\n1              9.78\n\n\nThe median annual average PM 2.5 concentration is 9.78 micrograms per cubic meter. This is the typical value for a county in the United States from 2008-2011.\nWe are exploring how air quality differs by geographic region as defined by the National Geographic Society. The regions include the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and West.\n\nconcentrations <- concentrations |>\n  mutate(Region = case_when(\n    StateName %in% northeast ~ \"Northeast\",\n    StateName %in% southeast ~ \"Southeast\",\n    StateName %in% midwest ~ \"Midwest\",\n    StateName %in% southwest ~ \"Southwest\",\n    StateName %in% west ~ \"West\"\n    )\n  )\n\nUsing this division of regions, the Southeast and Midwest regions have the most counties, while the Northeast region has the least.

In fact, several of the counties with the greatest average PM 2.5 concentrations were from the West region.\nWe hypothesized that the Northeast would have the worst air quality among the five region outlined since it has the greatest proportion of metropolitan areas and the highest average firms per county. To get a better idea of the true median average PM 2.5 concentration in Northeast counties, we calculated a confidence interval.\n\nset.seed(123)\n\nboot_df <- concentrations |>\n  filter(Region == \"Northeast\") |>\n  specify(response = avg_concentration) |>\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") |>\n  calculate(stat = \"median\")\n\nboot_df |>\n  summarize(lower = quantile(stat, 0.025),\n            upper = quantile(stat, 0.975))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower upper\n  <dbl> <dbl>\n1  9.17  9.45\n\n\nBased on the results above, we are 95% confident that the true median average PM 2.5 concentration in Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is between 9.17 and 9.45 micrograms per cubic meter.\nOur hypothesis is that the Northeast region would have the worst air quality. To test this, we ran a hypothesis test to compare to difference in median PM 2.5 concentration per county among Northeast counties and all other counties. Our null hypothesis is that the true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is the same as the true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other counties. Our alternative hypothesis is that the true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is greater than the true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other counties.

Therefore, we got a p-value greater than 0.999, meaning we fail to reject our null hypothesis. The incredibly high p-value signifies a surprising trend: the Northeast counties actually have a lower median PM 2.5 concentration than other U.S. counties from 2008-2011, which is unexpected since the Northeast tends to have more firms and a high proportion metropolitan areas.\n\n\nResults\nWe used the data analysis and visualization techniques to make meaning of the median annual average concentration of fine particle concentration. We created a counties by region graph to understand the statistical significance of the concentration data calculated for each region. Since the number of counties is the greatest for the Southeast and the Midwest region, the results of these two regions resembles have the highest chance of resembling closest to reality making them more statistically significant than the regions Southwest, West and Northeast.\nOur data analysis allowed us to find that overall the median annual average PM 2.5 concentration was 9.78 micrograms per cubic meter for all U.S. counties from 2008-2011. Then, the median annual average PM 2.5 concentration was calculated for each region. Southeast had the largest median annual average PM 2.5 concentration with a value of 10.6 micrograms per cubic meter followed by the Midwest with 9.6 micrograms per cubic meter, then Northeast with 9.3 micrograms per cubic meter, Southwest with 8.3 micrograms per cubic meter, and West with 7.0 micrograms per cubic meter. It is important to note that several of the regions have outliers especially the West region.\nBased on the visualizations and summary statistics, we came to the conclusion that the Southeast had the highest median annual average PM 2.5 concentration while the West had the lowest median annual average PM 2.5 concentration compared to the five main regions within the United States. In addition, we were surprised to find that the Northeast region, the region with the most highest proportion of metropolitan areas and the most business activity, actually had a lower median PM 2.5 concentration than all other counties. Although we expected the Northeast to have the worst air quality, it turns out it has a lower typical fine particle concentration than other regions.\n\n\nBibliography\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
