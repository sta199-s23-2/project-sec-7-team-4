    "text": "Literature Review\nThe article “Air Pollution Index Systems in the United States and Canada” explored and analyzed data similar to the data that will be analyzed in this report. This study surveyed all available air pollution indices through literature review and conversations with air pollution control agencies in the US and found that 35 out of 55 metropolitan air pollution control agencies used some form of daily air pollution index. The study developed a system to classify the indices into 14 different types based on four criteria. It was found that no two indices were exactly the same. The survey results and agency comments were used to identify characteristics and criteria for a uniform air pollution index. This report will differ from this study because this report will not analyze different indexes but rather use data from Air Quality Monitoring Stations across the United States to explore how air pollution potentially differs across regions in the United States. This will provide meaningful data and better identify areas of concern, which may help future efforts on addressing air pollution in the United States.\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\n\nFirst, we explored which regions have the greatest proportion of metropolitan areas. We found that the Northeast leads all regions in this statistic, as about 60% of their counties were marked as metropolitan in 2013. The Southeast had the second greatest proportion at about 45%. The other three regions (Midwest, Southwest, and West) had about 30% of their counties marked as metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we found the median county population per region in 2011 and found that the Northeast had the greatest median population at about 100,000. All four other regions had a median population between 20,000 and 30,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can look at the air pollution data.\nThe air_quality data set contains several statistics on fine particle concentrations and ozone concentrations on the county level in the United States from 2001 to 2011. Our analysis will focus on the annual average ambient concentrations of PM 2.5 based on seasonal averages and daily measurement, and we will be looking at the data from 2008 to 2011. We chose these years because we wanted to get an idea of the most recent air quality measures from the data.\n\n\n\nThe distribution of average county PM 2.5 concentration in the United States from 2008-2011 can be seen with a histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of annual average PM 2.5 concentrations is right skewed, so there are a few counties with large outliers. In general, concentrations range between about 4 and 22 micrograms per cubic meter. The peak occurs at 10 micrograms per cubic meter.\nFor our analysis, we will be using the median annual average PM 2.5 concentration as our summary statistic rather than the mean. Because the distribution is skewed, the median would be more representative of the center of the data than the mean.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  med_concentration\n              <dbl>\n1              9.78\n\n\nThe median annual average PM 2.5 concentration is 9.78 micrograms per cubic meter. This is the typical value for a county in the United States from 2008-2011.\nNext, we looked at how fine particle concentration was related to population.\n\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear positive relationship between population and average concentration of PM 2.5 particles, indicating that counties with more people tend to have worse air pollution, on average. In addition, we looked at how PM 2.5 concentration differs between metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like metropolitan areas do tend to have a greater average annual concentration of PM 2.5 particles. As we found before, the Northeast has the greatest proportion of metropolitan counties and the greatest median county population. Because greater populations and metropolitan areas are associated with more air pollution, we expect the Northeast to have a greater median concentration than all other regions.\n\n\n\nWe compared the median annual concentration of fine particles for counties in each region to get an initial look of the regions suffering from poor air quality the most.\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Region    med_concentration\n  <chr>                 <dbl>\n1 Southeast             10.6 \n2 Midwest                9.80\n3 Northeast              9.31\n4 Southwest              8.32\n5 West                   6.97\n\n\nThe Southeast region has the greatest median concentration of PM 2.5 particles (10.6 micrograms per cubic meter), while the West region has the lowest (6.97 micrograms per cubic meter).\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the distributions of average PM 2.5 concentration by region, it is evident that there are many counties in the West region with high average PM 2.5 concentrations. In fact, several of the counties with the greatest average PM 2.5 concentrations were from the West region.\nWe hypothesized that the Northeast would have the worst air quality among the five region outlined since it has the greatest proportion of metropolitan areas and the highest median population. To get a better idea of the true median average PM 2.5 concentration in Northeast counties, we calculated a confidence interval.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower upper\n  <dbl> <dbl>\n1  9.17  9.45\n\n\nBased on the results above, we are 95% confident that the true median average PM 2.5 concentration in Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is between 9.17 and 9.45 micrograms per cubic meter.\nWe decided to conduct a hypothesis test because it could provide an answer to whether there would be a difference between the air quality of the Northeast compared to other regions. Our hypothesis is that the Northeast region would have the worst air quality. To test this, we ran a hypothesis test to compare to difference in median PM 2.5 concentration per county among Northeast counties and all other counties. Our null hypothesis is that the true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is the same as the true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other counties. Our alternative hypothesis is that the true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is greater than the true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other counties. We set our significance level \\(\\alpha\\) at 0.05. Simulation-based techniques were used because they are generally less restrictive than theory-based techniques.\n\\(H_o: \\mu_{ne} - \\mu_{other}\\) = 0\n\\(H_a: \\mu_{ne} - \\mu_{other}\\) > 0\n\\(\\mu_{ne}\\): true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011\n\\(\\mu_{other}\\): true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other (non-Northeast) counties from 2008-2011\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  is_northeast median_concen\n  <chr>                <dbl>\n1 Northeast             9.31\n2 Other                 9.82\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    <dbl>\n1       1\n\n\nEven though the point estimate is far away from the null distribution, we hypothesized the Northeast counties would have a higher median concentration of PM 2.5 particles, so the point estimate is far off in the wrong direction! Therefore, we got a p-value greater than 0.999, meaning we fail to reject our null hypothesis that the true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is the same as the true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other counties. There is weak evidence to conclude the alternative hypothesis that the true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is greater than the true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other counties. The incredibly high p-value signifies a surprising trend: the Northeast counties actually have a lower median PM 2.5 concentration than other U.S. counties from 2008-2011, which is unexpected since the Northeast tends to have more firms and a high proportion metropolitan areas.\n\n\nResults\nWe used the data analysis and visualization techniques to make meaning of the median annual average concentration of fine particle concentration. We found that annual average concentration of fine particle concentration is related to population size and whether a county is a metropolitan area. In addition, we found that the Northeast had the highest proportion of metropolitan counties and the greatest median population size.\nOur data analysis allowed us to find that overall the median annual average PM 2.5 concentration was 9.78 micrograms per cubic meter for all U.S. counties from 2008-2011. Then, the median annual average PM 2.5 concentration was calculated for each region. Southeast had the largest median annual average PM 2.5 concentration with a value of 10.6 micrograms per cubic meter followed by the Midwest with 9.6 micrograms per cubic meter, then Northeast with 9.3 micrograms per cubic meter, Southwest with 8.3 micrograms per cubic meter, and West with 7.0 micrograms per cubic meter. It is important to note that several of the regions have outliers especially the West region.\nThen, we analyzed how population levels play a role in the presence of pollution in regions. One visualization demonstrated how there is a direct relationship between population and air pollution while a violin visualization showed how metro areas have more air pollution. We then hypothesized that the Northeast has the highest air pollution and thus the worst air quality since it has the greatest proportion of metropolitan counties and the greatest median county population. Thus we estimated the true median average PM 2.5 concentration with a confidence interval using bootstrap methods. We used a confidence interval because initially we wanted to estimate the true median average PM 2.5 concentration, and confidence intervals are helpful for estimations. A bootstrap distribution was utilized because the Central Limit Theorem does not apply for medians.\nThen a hypothesis test was conducted to compare the difference in median PM 2.5 concentration per county among Northeast counties and all other counties. A hypothesis test was chosen because there were two options presented; therefore, a hypothesis test could provide evidence for which option was most true given the data. The alternative hypothesis was that the true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is greater than the true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other counties; however, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the true median PM 2.5 concentration for Northeast counties from 2008-2011 is the same as the true median PM 2.5 concentration for all other counties.\n\n\nDiscussion\nBased on the visualizations and summary statistics, we came to the conclusion that the Northeast has a lower true median annual PM 2.5 concentration than other regions in the United States. We were surprised to find that the Northeast region, the region with the most highest proportion of metropolitan areas and the greatest population, actually had a lower median PM 2.5 concentration than all other counties. Although we expected the Northeast to have the worst air quality, it turns out it has a lower typical fine particle concentration than other regions.\nThe primary limitation of this data analysis is the short time span and older date of the data (only between 2008-2011). As a result, the air pollution data may no longer be accurate for each region in 2023, as drastic changes may have occurred in the past ten years. It is thus difficult to determine trends in air pollution and concretely determine causes without having a longer period of time to study and analyze. The analysis could thus be significantly improved if more recent data were available, allowing us to look at data over a longer period of time from 2008-2023.\nAnother potential limitation of the results of this analysis is the aggregation of data into large regions, when levels of air pollution across the region likely vary significantly. Therefore, future research could be conducted for more specific and reasonable ways of dividing the country for analysis than broad regions. Additionally, there exist many more ways of measuring air pollution than just PM 2.5, so future work could also incorporate other indicators of air quality and air pollution beyond just PM 2.5.\n\n\nBibliography\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
